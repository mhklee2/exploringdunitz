   In 1980, LA City Council formally recognized Koreatown as a section of the city of Los Angeles, allocating the areas between Vermont Avenue, Western Avenue, Third Street, and Olympic as the Korean hub in the Los Angeles County. Koreans had been migrating to the states for many years prior, but with the formal recognition, Koreatown became ingrained into the dynamics of Los Angeles. In the past, Koreatown has been a very fragmented and racially divided area, with Koreans believing that only those that looked like them were seen on equal footing which can be seen through the artwork in the early 90s. However, the Koreatown of today is a modern hub that has undergone a radical change, expanding in diversity and acceptance as a result of the changing urban landscape, the exodus of the more prosperous Korean-Americans which has been replaced with an influx of millenials, and the diffusion of Korean culture that has swept the globe. 
   
   The presence of Korean-Americans was once that of a proud and exclusive group. With the memory of Japanese internment, the Korean War, and migrational restrictions by the US fresh in their minds, ethnic homogeneity was one truth that many Korean immigrants held as they began to build better lives for themselves and their posterity. The co-mingling of other nationalities at the same level of respect in a social setting was discouraged as Koreans’ trust for any ethnicity that was not their own had vanished. In the 1900’s, there were many murals commissioned to liven up the city that had just been torn down by the Rodney King Riots. There are two murals, one done by a Japanese-American and Chinese American, another done by a Korean American, whose comparison reveals quite a bit about the Korean mindset in the past and provides context for the change that has been going on in recent years.
   
   The first mural, “Remember Your Roots” (shown below) was created by Tony Osumi and Darryl Mar in 1994. The two were UCLA graduates studying Asian American studies and had little contact with Koreantown prior, but were tasked with envisioning the soul of Koreatown within a mural. Original they planned to focus on the heritage of Koreans, but when they interacted with the community, they found a much more diverse narrative where Korean-American children openly played with Latino-American and African-American children and “they discovered that Koreatown isn't just for Korean Americans” (LA Times Leslie Berestein). This led to the creation of a mural that incorporated the inspiration of Korean heritage along with the true representation of the community, bringing together multiple races and generations that are true indications of Koreatown’s populace.

   Koreatown’s changing urban landscape and recent diversification can be attributed in large part to the residential real estate market which is being commanded by millennials who are demanding affordable housing that also has alluring amenities, which can all be found in Koreatown. Koreatown is becoming a residential hotspot and has begun to introduce new elements into Koreatown’s racial dynamics. According to the Commercial Observer and Dale Yonkin, an executive at Nadel Architects who works heavily in the area, Koreatown is a strong, centralized market that has the capabilities to grow even more due to its affordability and great amenities. With many of those in the market for urban condos or apartments, there has been a large spike in demand for areas like Koreatown that offer modern housing in an urban setting that is not directly in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles. As Dale Yonkin puts it, the demand for living in such an area as Koreatown is “driven by basically people who are looking for a kinder and gentler downtown [...] it’s a little less urban and yet it has a lot of the same amenities. It’s probably one of the strongest restaurant areas in L.A. and it has very walkable streets and will become more so as the density increases.” 
   
   With this demand alive, developers are devising the most creative ways to cater towards this market. All together, developers have created over three thousand units of housing in the past two years and plans are already under way for five thousand units to be created. The effects of such a massive amount of development being catered to younger generations have already begun to show to the natives. Keum Rin-Baik, one such native who has lived in the community since 1976, has commented on how much Koreatown has changed, saying that “ten years ago, non-Koreans made up 10% of [his] customers [at Kobawoo]. Now, it’s more like 30%. It’s the hallyu—Korean culture is popular now” (First We Feast Steph Cha). More and more Koreatown finds itself changing as the demand for its residences shows no sign of slowing. In this year alone, LA Curbed predicts the development of over thirty residential/mixed-use projects. Major streets like Wilshire and Vermont find themselves being flooded with projects as companies like Jamison Services seem “to be on a mission to singlehandedly reinvent the neighborhood” (LA Curbed Elijah Chiland). 
   
   Due to the “American Dream” that gripped many immigrants, there is a noticeable exodus out of Koreatown in those who attain greater socio-economic status. The goal for many Koreans hailing from the home country was the goal for almost all immigrants: to be more successful and live better lives than the ones they left behind. To so many like elders in my own family, who immigrated from Korea in the 70s, being able to live with greater socio-economic means in the “true” America was the end all be all. “To Koreans or Korean-Americans, Koreatown is something temporary” (Boo Eung Koh, 55). Rather than being a place that many wanted to spend their entire lives in, “Koreatown is a [temporary] comforting place in that [immigrants] do not have to face any language and cultural barriers in their new American life” (Boo Eung Koh, 56). They utilized this familiar background as a fallback point in case assimilation became too difficult; “however, Korean-Americans who [...] succeeded in culturally assimilating to American life in business or career tr[ied] to escape Koreantown by moving to more prestigious residential areas such as Santa Monica or Irvine” (Boo Eung Koh, 56). Koreatown’s prominence to Koreans has begun to falter as it becomes less and less Korean with the rise of more Americanized generations. This gap that has been created now continues to fuel the inundation of millennials into Koreatown’s culture.
